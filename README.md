# CHAPS 

Configuration Hardening Assessment PowerShell Scripts (CHAPS) are scripts designed to evaluate the security posture of a Windows system by checking its configuration settings against recommended security best practices. They don't modify the system configuration themselves, but rather report on potential vulnerabilities and suggest remediation steps.
